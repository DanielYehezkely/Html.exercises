    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background: darkcyan;
    margin: 50px;
    position: relative;
}
/* Answer 1 */
/* i added relative position to .outer and reason is we want that the inner square will be 10px from the top of the outer square, so an absolute position will relate to the first relative element, in the first case it got related to the default relative - the browser. */

.container {
    position: absolute;
}

h3 {
    margin-bottom: 5px;
    margin-top: 0;
}

.inner {
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    background: lightgreen;
    margin-top: 5px;
    }
    

    /* Answer 2 */
    /*First i enclosed the text in a heading element, then i had to div the text and the inner square so i can keep the gap between them(inner) and the outer while using positioning meanwhile i used the opposite margin (bottom vs top) for keeping the gap between the text and the inner.  */
