# JavaScript Course Exercises

This repository contains various **JavaScript exercises** completed as part of my **JavaScript course** during the front-end development program at Appleseeds Academy. These exercises focus on improving proficiency in fundamental JavaScript concepts such as variables, functions, loops, and more advanced topics like DOM manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous programming.

## Overview

These exercises helped solidify my understanding of core JavaScript concepts, as well as how to apply them in real-world scenarios. Each exercise focuses on a specific aspect of the language and is designed to improve problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

## Exercises

1. **Variables and Data Types**: Working with variables, strings, numbers, and basic data types.
2. **Functions**: Creating and calling functions, understanding scope and closures.
3. **Loops and Iteration**: Using `for`, `while`, and `forEach` loops to iterate through data.
4. **Arrays and Objects**: Manipulating arrays and objects, common methods, and properties.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The core language for all exercises.
- **HTML5**: Used for creating the structure of exercise pages.
- **CSS3**: Basic styling for some of the exercises involving DOM manipulation.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Each exercise is in its own folder, named according to the topic it covers.
3. Open any folder and launch the `index.html` file in your preferred browser to test the JavaScript functionality.
